# Things For Thought - Kick-off Session Summary

## Course Schedule and Contact
The course runs from October 28th onwards, with sessions on Mondays and Tuesdays from 10-4 in rooms R402/403. During Dutch Design Week (19-22.10), students will have homework assignments. The course is led by A.Stankowski@udk-berlin.de, with additional support from Lukas available from November.

## Course Objectives
The course aims to bridge theory and practice through project-based learning. Students will develop projects that make informed statements on impactful topics while gaining inspiration from research on how design shapes both individuals and society. The curriculum emphasizes understanding techno-social effects, techno-economic systems, and design's role as a commodity in various markets.

## Core Learning Outcomes
Students will develop expertise in researching and debating complex topics, becoming proficient in giving and receiving feedback. The course focuses on building literacy in techno-social and techno-individual effects, while understanding how design functions across different market contexts.

## Course Expectations
Regular attendance and active participation are essential components of the course. Students are expected to demonstrate commitment to their projects and research, while maintaining a collaborative spirit. Projects should align with the course's central theme of automation implications and the ontological dimension of design.

## Theoretical Framework
The course explores the fundamental question: "How do the tools we use change the way we think?" This connects to the concept of 'designing and being designed,' with recommended viewing at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kdRdzxdZQ and further reading at https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/ontological-design-is-popular-in-design-academia-but-what-is-it/

## Automation Drivers
The course examines various motivations behind automation, including efficiency gains, social adoption patterns, platform dependencies, competitive advantages, and their broader implications for design and society.

## Reading Assignments
Required readings include "How Computers Change the Way We Think" by Sherry Turkle, "Absolute PowerPoint" by Ian Parker (https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/28/absolute-powerpoint), and "The Myth of Multi-Tasking" by Christine Rosen (https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-myth-of-multitasking).

## Project Timeline
The semester is structured across five months:
October focuses on topic research and selection. November is dedicated to project expression, drafting, and prototyping. December involves project definition and scope refinement, culminating in mid-term presentations. January emphasizes building, coding, and project refinement. February concludes with project finalization and final presentations.

## Next Session Assignment
Students prepare a 5-slide presentation about a project they admire, analyzing what makes it exceptional both personally and objectively. The presentation should address how the project influences thinking and usage patterns, with comparisons to similar projects where applicable.
