# Things For Thought - Week 2 Slides Summary

## Course Overview
Today's session encompassed several key components of the course, beginning with studio setup and progressing through side quest check-ins, reading club discussions, and project planning sessions. The class structure emphasized interactive learning and collaborative discussion.

## Git Side-Quest
Students are introduced to version control through Git, with resources hosted at https://github.com/saeneas/things-for-thought. The repository provides various difficulty levels to accommodate different skill levels, encouraging peer learning and collaboration in mastering version control fundamentals.

## Reading Club Analysis
The class discussed two significant texts. The first, "How Computers Change The Way We Think," explored metaphors and mental models, particularly examining the relationship between closed and open systems, while incorporating personal experiences into the discussion. The second text, "Absolute Powerpoint," generated group analysis about presentation tools and their impact on communication.

## Academic Disciplines
The course intersects with three primary academic fields. Interaction Design Research and HCI provide essential theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for design argumentation. Science and Technology Studies (STS) offers historical context and understanding of technology adoption. Future Studies is recommended for inspiration, while Digital Humanities was noted as less relevant to the course focus.

## Current Reading Assignment
Students are currently engaging with the concept of Affordances through a comprehensive resource available at: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/affordances

## Project Development
A successful project serves multiple purposes, from personal development to professional advancement. Projects should demonstrate technical competence while providing learning opportunities, new design perspectives, portfolio material, networking possibilities, and potential exhibition exposure. Students must consider their learning objectives, building goals, and project statements throughout the development process.

## Timeline Management
The four-month semester is structured to progress through distinct phases: research, learning, prototyping, and building/implementation. While learning occurs throughout, the focus gradually shifts toward concrete results and implementation as the semester advances.

## Featured Projects
Two exemplary projects were showcased. Jeffrey Krieger's PODIUM combines skateboarding with space design, creating modular configurations for schools and sports centers. Agatha Prieto Jeanty's installation explores cultural heritage through multimedia, integrating sound and braiding techniques to connect with Haitian ancestry.

## Research Best Practices
Successful project research requires comprehensive documentation and reference collection. Students are encouraged to build upon existing work while developing their unique approaches. The alignment of skills, medium choice, and message is crucial for project success.

## Project Direction
Students should begin exploring potential project formats, whether documentary, product design, installation, or speculative work. They should start building reference collections, identifying learning requirements, and developing initial project visions that align with their chosen direction.

## Success Criteria
Projects are evaluated based on their ability to communicate clear statements to target audiences, effective implementation, and thorough documentation. Since many student projects may not see immediate practical use, the communication aspect becomes a crucial component of the project itself.
